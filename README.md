# Food System Functioning Indicators
Open data repository for food system functioning indicators in the United States

### Rationale
The Center for a Livable Future's (CLF) Food System Sustainable and Public Health Program (FSSPH) has been compiling data on U.S., state, and county level measures of food system functioning. To support long-term food security, governments, businesses and other food system actors must be able to anticipate and respond effectively to physical, economic, and social shocks and stressors – like those posed by COVID-19. We have reviewed academic and grey literature on food system resilience and have found a worrisome gap in understanding of how to measure impacts of events like a pandemic on the U.S. food system, and what actions or conditions could make a food system more resilient to such events over time.   

The need for more information on how all aspects of the food system are impacted by COVID-19, and which responses are most effective, is becoming ever more apparent as the virus continues to spread throughout communities across the U.S. To be able to respond most effectively in real-time, as well as understand how to prepare and respond better in a future crisis like this, cities, non-profits, businesses, and researchers need to know how COVID-19 is impacting access, availability, affordability, and acceptability across U.S. communities. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive/ centralized data collected on these food system impacts, nor on the responses happening and evolving daily. Our goal in making these data publicly available is to aid response to COVID-19's impact on the food system, and provide resources to prepaer for future crises.

### About CLF 
Our Mission
The Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) works with students, educators, researchers, policymakers, advocacy organizations and communities to build a healthier, more equitable and resilient food system.

Our Contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals
The Center’s work aligns with many of the United Nations’ 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in different ways. Because we operate at the intersection of public health and food systems, our work naturally contributes to a cross-section of the SDGs, especially the goals related to ending poverty, ending hunger and malnutrition, and achieving good health and wellbeing.
