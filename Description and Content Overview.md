# Food System Functioning Indicators
Open data repository for food system functioning indicators in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic

### Rationale
The Center for a Livable Future (CLF) has compiled data on U.S. national, state, and county level measures of food system functioning. To support long-term food security, governments, businesses and other food system actors must be able to anticipate and respond effectively to physical, economic, and social shocks and stressors – like those posed by COVID-19. We have reviewed academic and grey literature on food system resilience and have found a worrisome gap in understanding how to measure impacts of events like a pandemic on the U.S. food system, and what actions or conditions could make a food system more resilient to such events over time.   

The need for more information on how all aspects of the food system are impacted by COVID-19, and which responses are most effective, is becoming ever more apparent as the virus continues to spread throughout communities across the U.S. To be able to respond most effectively in real-time, as well as understand how to prepare and respond better in a future crisis like this, cities, non-profits, businesses, and researchers need to know how COVID-19 is impacting food access, availability, affordability, and acceptability across U.S. communities. This database provides a comprehensive, centralized source of data collected on these food system impacts, as wel as the policy and program responses to the pandemic and underlying socioeconomic factors in communities. Our goal in making these data publicly available is to aid response to and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the US. food system, and provide resources that can help policymakers, researchers, and food safety net organizations to prepare for future crises.
