## Frequently Asked Questions about the food system, food system functioning, and food system resilience

### 1. What do we mean by the "food system?"

We define food systems as “encompass[ing] all activities and resources that contribute to and influence producing, distributing, and consuming food, along with the drivers and outcomes of those processes” (Neff et. al., 2017).

###  2. What is resilience?

We consider resilience the ability of a system to prepare for, resist, and recover from adverse situations. A resilient food system should be able to maintain food availability, affordability, accessibility, and acceptability in the face of shocks or stressors, such as COVID-19 or a natural disaster. Resilience can be difficult to measure, so we assess it through how well the food system is functioning over time. Aspects of food system functioning are described below (affordability, accessibility, availability, acceptability).

### 3. What is food affordability?

Food affordability refers to an individual or population's financial ability to secure sufficient and desirable food. Measures of government assistance, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment to minimize financial barriers to food also fall within food affordability.

### 4. What is food availability? 

Food availability refers to the physical quantity of food available to consumers and whether supply is sufficient for the population it is intended for.

### 5. What is  food accessibility?

Accessible food is available within manageable distances and/or supported by infrastructures that enables a population to acquire abundant food without physical difficulty. For instance, lack of public transportation in an urban area may negatively impact physical food access.

### 6. What is food acceptability?

Food should be safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate. For instance, individuals with dietary restrictions due to religious or moral beliefs should be able to secure plentiful amounts of food to support their diet without considerable difficulty.

## Questions about the data

### 7. What is the date range of the data?

This varies by the indicator, but whenever possible data are collected from 2010 to the present. Therefore, these data can be used to understand the potential impact of events prior to the COVID-19 pandemic on the food system.

### 8. What geographic units do these data cover?

Data are most often available at the state level, but when this is not possible we provide data are the regional or national level. Some data are also available at the county level.

### 9. Do you plan on updating these data and if so, with what frequency?

Yes, we plan on updating these data on a quarterly basis. 

### 10. Are any CLF analyses of these data available?

Yes! We are wrapping up initial data analyses and will be sharing preliminary results. Check back here for future updates.
